## Overview
**Project Eyes On** is a hyper-fast, multi-threaded surveillance tool designed to locate open IP cameras across the globe. It combines two powerful engines:
1.  **Directory Scraper**: Harvests feeds from Insecam.
2.  **Deep Web Dorking**: Uses Google & Yahoo search dorks to find hidden cameras not listed in public directories.

## Features
-   **Parallel Engine**: Queries **Yahoo** and **Startpage** simultaneously for maximum speed and results.
-   **GeoIP Enrichment**: Automatically resolves camera IP locations to **City, Country** (e.g., "New York, United States").
-   **Smart Deduplication**: Merges results from multiple engines to ensure unique feeds.
-   **Direct Connection**: Optimized for speed without unreliable proxies.
-   **Country Targeting**: Target specific regions (e.g., `/country US`, `/country RU`).
-   **Live Verification**: Automatically detects stream types (MJPEG, JPEG, Video).
